# OS_LAB
Experiments performed during OS lab

P1: To Write a C program to read a file and copy the contents into a new file using system calls.

P2: Process creation and termination using fork(), exit() and wait() system calls.

P3: Write a C program that creates a new child process. The child process should be assigned to do the task of finding the length of your name.

P4: Write a program to implement following Disk Scheduling Algorithms.

P5: Implement FCFS and Non preemptive Shortest Job first algorithm.

P6: Write a program to implement Shortest Job First (Preemptive version).

P7: Write a program to implement Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm.

P8: Write a program to implement Banker's Algorithm. The program should either print the safe sequence of execution of given processes (if any exists) or print "There is a deadlock in the system".

P9: Implement the reader writer problem and record your observations. Simulate two children process that try to read/write the file simultaneously.

P10: Write a program to implement Least Recently Used algorithm for page replacement.
